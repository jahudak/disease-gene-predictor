# disease-gene-predictor

This is our semester project for the VITMMA19 Deep Learning course. It leverages graph neural networks and real-life medical data from DISGENET to predict disease-gene associations.

The project will include a model and a learning framework based on PyTorch Lightning and PyTorch Geometric, a semi-automatic LaTeX documentation solution and an MLaaS application as well.
